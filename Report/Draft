Changing the weights in the phase2 algorithms created trends in the data. When W1 is higher, the memory requirement decreases, the path cost increases, and runtime decreases. When W2 is higher, the results are similar to a higher W1. 
Overall, Sequential A* has a higher runtime and memory requirement than Integrated A*. Integrated A* tends to has a better run time than Uniform Search while Sequential A* has the largest run times of all the algorithms in the report. Sequential A* ‘s multiple open list result in a higher memory requirement than a majority of the other algorithms in the report. Sequential A* expands more nodes than Integrated A* but less than Uniform algorithm. The results showed the experimental w1 and w2 used resulted in suboptimal costs. The phase2 algorithms costs were largely worse than using inadmissible heuristics for A* but better than using inadmissible heuristics for weighted A in terms of cost.
